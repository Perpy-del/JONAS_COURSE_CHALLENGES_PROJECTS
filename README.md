# JONAS FULL COURSE ON UDEMY

Creating a github page and storing most of the information I gained throughout the course especially the challenges and projects all in one place for review purposes.

## Coding Challenge #1

There are two gymnastics team, the Dolphins and the Koalas! Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

### Requirements

- Create an arrow function `calcAverage` to calculate the average of 3 scores.

- Use the function to calculate the average for both teams.

- Create a function `checkWinner` that takes the average score of each team as parameters (`avgDolphins` and `avgKoalas`), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas wim (30 vs. 13)".

- Use the `checkWinner` function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.

- Ignore draws this time.

### Use Test Cases

- TEST DATA 1: Doliphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65. 54 and 49.

- TEST DATA 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27.
